//! Block Miner
//!
//! This module is dedicated to the mining process within the Stratus Ethereum blockchain system. It encompasses the mechanisms and algorithms used for creating new blocks in the blockchain, a fundamental aspect of maintaining the blockchain's integrity and continuity.
//!
//! The Block Miner is designed to work in tandem with the transaction processing system, particularly with the `executor` module. Unlike traditional blockchain systems that rely on time-based block creation, the Block Miner in Stratus project is geared towards generating blocks based on transaction activities. This approach ensures that block generation is more responsive to the actual usage and demands of the blockchain, facilitating a more efficient and dynamic blockchain environment.
//!
//! Components:
//! - `block_miner`: The core of the block mining process, this submodule contains the logic and algorithms necessary for constructing new blocks from processed transactions. It is responsible for organizing transaction data, validating transactions, and finalizing block creation.
//!
//! The Block Miner plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the Stratus blockchain, aligning with the project's vision of a flexible, efficient, and responsive blockchain system.
