☁️ Stratus: The Interplanetary EVM Executor & JSON-RPC Server ☁️

Welcome to Stratus! We're not just any EVM executor and JSON-RPC server. We're an interplanetary EVM executor and JSON-RPC server, built with the power and safety of Rust 🦀. And the best part? Our custom storage scales horizontally. That's right, we're all about that growth! 📈

🚀 Our Journey 🚀

Our journey began in 2016 when we at CloudWalk, Inc., decided to use Ethereum to build our payment acquirer. We've tried various networks and private ledger solutions, but as we scaled, latency became an issue. So, we decided to create our own EVM ledger, named Stratus, and we open-sourced it. This technology will help us build an interplanetary payment network, processing trillions of transactions on planet Earth and soon others.

🗃️ Our Current Storage Implementations 🗃️

We're proud to offer the following storage implementations:

- In Memory: For those who like to live in the moment.
- PostgreSQL: For those who prefer the tried-and-true.

🌌 What's Next for Stratus? 🌌
We're always looking to the future here at CloudWalk, and with Stratus it is no different. Here's what's on our horizon:

- Redis: Fast, flexible, and about to be part of the Stratus family.
- CockroachDB: The resilient DB that's perfect for cloud services like us.
- L2 Proof Mechanisms to Ethereum Mainnet: To enable some decentralization, with the goal of achieving awesome latency.

Stay tuned for these exciting updates!
