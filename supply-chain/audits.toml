Reviewed quick_cache 0.6.17.

- MIT license.
- Small, well-scoped changes vs 0.6.16: hashbrown bump; new Cache::set_capacity and memory_used APIs.
- No network or file IO; no build.rs.
- Default features use parking_lot and ahash; both can be disabled.
- Docs confirm scan-resistant S3-FIFO/Clock-PRO policy; values are cloned on get (use Arc<_> if heavy).
- Readme states only trivially verifiable unsafe; concurrency via locks/shards; no background threads.
- No RustSec advisories found as of 2025-10-13.
- Risks to note: ahash is non-cryptographic; ensure keys aren’t used for security-sensitive hashing.
