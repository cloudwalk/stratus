- Unsafe: None present.
- Network or file I/O: None present.
- Build scripts or proc-macros: None (no build.rs, no proc-macro crate).

Supply-Chain Security Vetting Summary

Code Injection / Execution Risk:
- No risk detected. No evidence of new unsafe execution paths, build-time abuse, or arbitrary code execution introduced in 0.4.43. New 'defmt' feature adds format derives but no runtime execution.

Network & Exfiltration Risk:
- No risk detected. No new network communication, telemetry, or external data transfer observed in the changes.

File System & Output Risk:
- No risk detected. No unexpected file reads/writes or artifact generation observed in the changes.

Data Leakage Risk:
- No risk detected. No new handling or exposure of sensitive data observed in the changes.

External Control / Seizure Risk:
- No risk detected. No new plugins, dynamic loading, or externally influenced execution paths found in the changes.

Supply-Chain Integrity Risk:
- No risk detected. Dependency updates ('pure-rust-locales' to 0.8.2, 'windows-bindgen' to 0.66) are minor and routine. No suspicious ownership changes, scope expansion, or other dependency anomalies identified.

Conclusion:
Based on the available evidence, the update of 'chrono' from 0.4.42 to 0.4.43 does not introduce observable supply-chain or security risks within the evaluated scope."""
